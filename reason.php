   </div>
    <p class="text-center" style="margin:4%; font-size:140%; font-family: fangsong; ">Donating money to HelpIT helps one get the blessings of those in 
    need and at the same time fulfil 
    one’s service to the Lord. The amount of money donated or the kind of service is of little significance. 
    What matters are the intentions with which a donation is made.
    Further, donating money to Childs is considered a noble act since HelpIT are the platform 
      where the devotees can perform their services to 
      the Childs and come in contact with Him. Therefore, helping in building the home of
     the Childrens career can be one of the best ways in which one can contribute.
     It is possible to donate without money as well. One can always donate one’s time to those who are in need. 
     Various programmes take place to honour the humanty as well as there are activities in the daily functioning 
     of the various spreadin to which one can contribute. 
      It is possible for a lot of people to donate money which can now happen 
      with a few clicks, however, devoting your time with the intention of service to the Lord is incomparable. It equates to an act of 
      selflessness which is done only to help the other person and detach oneself from the material world.
